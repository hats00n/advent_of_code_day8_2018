# Advent Of Code 2018 Day 8 Code Puzzle Solution
The puzzle was fun! Solved it with recursive approach.

The extractor module is responsible for extracting the tree and the Node represents a single node in the tree.

## Requirements
Only python3.7+
## How to Run/Test? 
Run the program with following command
```shell
python3 part1.py
```
The program expects an input in one line , containing file data (e.g. `1 2 3 4 5 6`).

You can get the input from a file with `python3 part1.py < testcase.txt` or `python3 part2.py < testcase.txt`
